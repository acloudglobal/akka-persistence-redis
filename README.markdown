## What is it?

Akka Persistence Redis Plugin is a plugin for Akka persistence that provides several components:
 - a journal store ;
 - a snapshot store ;
 - a journal query interface implementation.

This plugin stores data in a [redis](https://redis.io) database.

## (De)Serializion

The journal component saves serialized values into the database.
It relies on the [Akka serialization extension](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4/scala/serialization.html).
Custom serialization can be added to handle you data model elements as you wish.

## Using the Journal Component

To use the journal component, you need to enable it in your configuration. To use the default settings, simply add this line:

```scala
akka.persistence.journal.plugin = "akka-persistence-redis.journal"
```

### Tags

The journal component has support for tagged events.
All events wrapped inside an instance of class `akka.persistence.journal.Tagged` are associated to the provided tags in the data store.

## Using the Journal Query Interface Component

To use the journal query component, you need to enable it in your configuration. To use the default settings, simply add this line:

```scala
import akka.persistence.query._
import akka.persistence.query.journal.redis._

val readJournal = PersistenceQuery(system)
  .readJournalFor[ScalaReadJournal]("akka-persistence-redis.read-journal")
```

For more details on the available capabilities of the journal query, please refer to the API documentation.
